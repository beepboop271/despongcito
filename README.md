# despongcito
grade 10 comp sci with python (ICS2OG) project. had to create a game of pong with a partner (Joseph Wang). the previous versions folder contains the files that we sent each other because we both did not use git at the time. the gameplay is literally just pong, but some settings might make the game a bit more interesting.

have fun :))
